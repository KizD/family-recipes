Super Yummy Raspberry Buttermilk Pancakes

Ingredients
4 cups all-purpose flour    
1/4 cup granulated sugar           
1/2 cup dry buttermilk powder
2 teaspoons baking soda           
4 teaspoons baking powder        
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup individually frozen or fresh raspberries
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3 large eggs, whisked
1/4 cup melted butter or vegetable oil
3 cups cool water or enough to reach the desired consistency

Instructions

1. Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
2. Add the eggs, fat, extract, and water to the mix and stir until just combined. The batter will probably be too dry so add more water to reach the desired consistency.  Add the raspberries.
3. Cook the pancakes on a hot griddle, turning once.  Serve hot.
